       "\"\\\\n\\\\nArchive-name: cryptography-faq/part02\\\\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 2: Net Etiquette\\\\n\\\\nThis is the second of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\\\\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\\\\nWe don\\\\'t have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don\\\\'t ask.\\\\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]\\\\'\\\\' refer to the reference list in the last part.\\\\n\\\\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \\\\nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \\\\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \\\\nevery 21 days.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nContents:\\\\n\\\\n* What groups are around? What\\\\'s a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\\\\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\\\\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n* What groups are around? What\\\\'s a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\\\\n\\\\n  Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always\\\\n  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.\\\\n  You\\\\'ll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same\\\\n  newsgroup. After a month you\\\\'ll have a much better sense of what the\\\\n  readers want to see.\\\\n\\\\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\\\\n\\\\n  No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were\\\\n  created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be\\\\n  patented?\\\\'\\\\' don\\\\'t get in the way of technical discussions. Many\\\\n  sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,\\\\n  comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of\\\\n  people who don\\\\'t care about those other topics, try to put your\\\\n  postings in the right group.\\\\n\\\\n  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic\\\\n  ``spy stuff\\\\'\\\\' don\\\\'t belong in sci.crypt either.\\\\n\\\\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\\\\n\\\\n  ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here\\\\'s some\\\\n  ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?\\\\'\\\\' Without a\\\\n  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.\\\\n\\\\n  If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some\\\\n  ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by\\\\n  random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the\\\\n  opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is\\\\n  distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some\\\\n  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts\\\\n  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but\\\\n  this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most\\\\n  sci.crypt readers won\\\\'t bother with.\\\\n\\\\n  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,\\\\n  find out if it\\\\'s really new. Look through this FAQ for references and\\\\n  related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the\\\\n  introductory textbooks.\\\\n\\\\n  When you\""
