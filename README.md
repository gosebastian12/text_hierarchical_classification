# Hierarchical Text Classificiation
In this repository, you will find the work that I have done to create a tool-kit that is able to place fed-in articles in one of many hierarchical classes or nodes. The resources that have been instrumental and quite useful are the following:
1. [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Hierarchical Classification](https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-noa-weiss-the-hitchhikers-guide-to-hierarchical-classification-f8428ea1e076).
2. [Large Scale Hierarchical Classification: Foundations, Algorithms and Applications](https://cs.gmu.edu/~mlbio/presentation_SDM.pdf).
3. [Text Classification in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-classification-in-python-dd95d264c802).
4. [Want to be a “real world” Data Scientist?](https://towardsdatascience.com/want-to-be-a-real-world-data-scientist-make-these-changes-to-your-portfolio-projects-e61d1139c018).
5. [How to write a production-level code in Data Science?](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-write-a-production-level-code-in-data-science-5d87bd75ced).
6. [A Comprehensive Guide to Understand and Implement Text Classification in Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/04/a-comprehensive-guide-to-understand-and-implement-text-classification-in-python/).
7. [Cookiecutter Data Science — Organize your Projects — Atom and Jupyter](https://medium.com/@rrfd/cookiecutter-data-science-organize-your-projects-atom-and-jupyter-2be7862f487e).

Other more specific resources are listed in the docstrings (under the `References` section for each) for the functions written the module `./src`. There are also other `README` files in the important directories that can be consulted for more information on the purpose of everything in the repository.
